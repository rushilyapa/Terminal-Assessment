## Software Development Plan

### Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

Car Spa is a simple CLI app running on the Ruby program. The Car Spa app is where you're able to book in a spot for your car to be washed at your very own home. Most people around the world own a car, and with owning a car, comes with some responsiblity to keep it maintained. Washing a car may seem like a breeze, but it takes time and effort. The are a few options you have like, washing it at home, taking it to a self service wash bay or to your local car wash. Again, all options take time and effort especially for anyone with a busy lifestyle. This app is designed to solve that problem, you simply book in a spot whenever is convenient for you and someone will be sent to your home to complete the job. The target audience is broad as most people own a car however, it's main target would be anyone working from home or has a busy lifestyle. The member

### Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling
  
* Menu - The menu is the home page for the app. From here you can select the following listed below.

* View packges - 
  
* Book an appointment -
  
* View existing booking - 

### Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

The app is so simple, anyone can use it straight away. Once the user opens the app, they will begin at the menu screen, giving them 3 options. View Packages, Making Booking and Booking an Appointment. When the user clicks on View Packages, they are left with some description of each offering and price. One they have viewed that, the user is allow to either go back to the menu or exit. Make a Booking is straight foward, once user clicks on that, they are left with a section to fill out their details (Name, Address, Mobile etc)


### Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.	
 
### Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

### Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
