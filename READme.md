## Software Development Plan

### Statement of Purpose and Scope

Car Spa is a simple CLI app running on the Ruby program. The app allows you to view packages, make a booking or view an existing booking. Most people around the world own a car, and with owning a car, comes with some responsiblity to keep it maintained. Washing a car may seem like a breeze, but it takes time and effort. There are a few options you have like, washing it at home, taking it to a self service wash bay or to your local car wash. Again, all options take time and effort especially for anyone with a busy lifestyle. This app is designed to solve that problem, you simply book in a spot whenever is best convenient for you and someone will be sent to your home to complete the job. The target audience is very open as most people own a car however, it's main target would be anyone working from home or has a busy lifestyle etc. The member of the target audience simply downloads the program and runs it via their Command Line and from there, they will follow the prompts and within 60 seconds, the member can book a spot.

### Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling
  
* Menu - The menu is the home page for the app. From here you can select the following listed below.

* View packages - From here, you will see the packages laid out in a table form using the Terminal-Table Gem. The items will be listed along with what's included and the price. If user finds what they like, it will ask them if they would like to book, allowing it to loop back to "Make Booking" 
  
* Make Booking - Here, the user will input their details like Name, Mobile, Address and their vehicle details(Make and Model). This info will then be stored under "View existing booking"
  
* View existing booking - User can check out their booking if they have made one, if not, an error message will pop up letting them know that a booking has not been made and to check out the main menu to book a spot.

### Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

The app is so simple, anyone can use it straight away. Once the user opens the app, they will begin at the menu screen, giving them 3 options. View Packages, Making Booking and Booking an Appointment. When the user clicks on View Packages, they are left with some description of each offering and price. One they have viewed that, the user is allow to either go back to the menu or exit. Make a Booking is straight foward, once user clicks on that, they are left with a section to fill out their details (Name, Address, Mobile etc)


### Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.	
 
### Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

### Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
